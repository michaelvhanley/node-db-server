My Final Project  

I would like to make a database of vocal music, organized by pedagogical goals.  There are a few sources for vocal music already, mostly aimed at performers/students. It would be nice if this could adapt/connect with current sources of vocal music (classical aria collections, musical theatre anthologies, etc.) to pull data from, but I'm not sure if the data exists in any accessible format.  It would be great if this were open source, so that teachers could add to it.  I'd like for it to be user-friendly and better than a spreadsheet.   

UPDATE: 12/10

Database created and HTML set for page.  

UPDATE: 12/15

HTML updated to separate input into individual shows and create HMTL button for each show from the DB.
